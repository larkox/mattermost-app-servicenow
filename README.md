# Service Now app for Mattermost

## Local Development Install

1. Running `make` will build the executable and start the server.
  - A base URL can be added so links are sent based on that url (e.g. `make BASE=http://myurl.com`). Defaults to `http://localhost:3000`.
  - An address can be added for the "ListenAndServe" function (e.g. `make ADDR=:3000`). Defaults to `:3000`.
2. Set up your instance to use the Apps Framework debug commands.
3. Add the manifest to your instance using the following command: `/apps debug-add-manifest --url BASE/manifest`.
4. Run the following command in Mattermost: `/apps install --app-id com.mattermost.servicenow`.
5. As secret key, use `1234`.
